% Opening salutation
\noindent Dear Editors,

\noindent Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled ``Lorem Ipsum Dolor: Consectetuer Adipiscing Elit" which we are submitting for consideration for publication in \textit{\journalname}.

\section{}
\noindent In recent years, it has become clear this line of research is necessary. \lipsum[1] 

\section{}
\noindent Our approach represents the first time a group has generated data that would allow exploration of a variety of questions. The most salient of which we explore here: 

\section{}
In our study, we present evidence that supports Model 1 \citep{zany2023quantum} over Model 2 \citep{wacky2023spaghetti}, which is significant for several reasons:

\begin{description}
  \item[(1)] We observe Y, which aligns with groups A and B but not C in their model system. Notably, our model system is far more relevant for reasons including...
  \item[(2)] We also comment on X, which has long been a mystery unsolved by any group but ours, thanks to our unique dataset.
  \item[(3)] Finally, it is abundantly clear from our findings that competing labs have not considered...
\end{description}

\restoregeometry % This will apply the geometry settings from the preamble for the subsequent pages
\section{Summary of Scientific Grounds for Consideration at \journalname}
\noindent Our is either groundbreaking and paradigm shifting or obvious. It promises to be cited in tenure dossiers for generations to come. This work is sure to bolster \textit{\journalname}'s impact factor which is really the most important thing. 

\section{Summary of Appeal to a Broad Audience}
\noindent This manuscript is not just for the high-minded academics but also has quite appealing figures to just look at, or even frame and put on your wall. 




\section{Advice on Selecting Qualified and Fair Reviewers}
\noindent We advise selecting reviewers who are early-career investigators as they likely will actually read the manuscript and provide substantive feedback. Our last manuscript was under review for 12 months, after which time Reviewer 2 died at age 95.


\section{Items Included in This Submission}
\noindent Included with our manuscript is a Supplementary Information section that is so detailed, it could be another whole paper. We also enclosed a couple amazon gift cards for the editors.
