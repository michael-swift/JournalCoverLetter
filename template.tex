\noindent Dear [Editor(s)],

\noindent Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled ``Lorem Ipsum Dolor: Consectetuer Adipiscing Elit" which we are submitting for consideration for publication in \textit{\journalname}.

\subsubsection{}
\noindent In recent years, it has become clear this line of research is necessary. \lipsum[1] 

\subsubsection{}
\noindent Our approach represents the first time a group has generated data that would allow exploration of a variety of questions. The most salient of which we explore here: 

\subsubsection{}
In our study, we present evidence that supports Model 1 \citep{zany2023quantum} over Model 2 \citep{wacky2023spaghetti}, which is significant for several reasons:

\begin{description}
  \item[(1)] We observe Y, which aligns with groups A and B but not C in their model system. Notably, our model system is far more relevant for reasons including...
  \item[(2)] We also comment on X, which has long been a mystery unsolved by any group but ours, thanks to our unique dataset.
  \item[(3)] Finally, it is abundantly clear from our findings that competing labs have not considered...
